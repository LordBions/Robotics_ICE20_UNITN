First of all, you need to prepare our project and its requirements following the full report guidelines.

>It's better to have a stable internet connection in order to exploit as well as possible yolov5 features

1. Open the terminal
2. move into catkin_ws folder with `cd ~/Robotics_ICE23_UNITN/catkin_ws`
3. Do a catkin_make `catkin_make install`
4. Open a new terminal
5. execute `bash ~/Robotics_ICE23_UNITN/start.sh`
6. Check the Gazebo environment
7. Wait for Homing Procedure Accomplished
8. Select the **assignment number**

# Robotics_ICE23_UNITN
For our university exam

This project requires ROS Noetic Ninjemys in ubuntu focal fossa(20.04) operative system, and gazebo software in order to run correctly.

## Set up
----------------------------
First of all, you need to prepare our project and its requirements following the full report guidelines in the documents folder.
1. Install ROS (Report: page 3 - chapt 2.1)
2. Install Python3 (Report: page 4 - chapt 2.2)
3. Install and configure git (Report: page 4 - chapt 2.3)
4. Install pip3 (Report: page 5 . chapt 2.4)
5. Install catkin (Report: page 5 - chapt 2.5)
6. Install locosim (optional) and configure our .bashrc (mandatory) (Report. page 6 - chapt 2.6)
7. Install Yolov5 (Report: page 6 - chapt 2.7)
8. Install Pythorc (Report: page 6 - chapt 2.8)
9. Install Eigen and Ipython (Report. page 7 - chapt: 2.9)
10. Clone our repo (Report: page 7 - chapter 2.10)

>It's better to have a stable internet connection in order to exploit as well as possible yolov5 features

1. Open the terminal
2. move into catkin_ws folder with `cd ~/Robotics_ICE23_UNITN/catkin_ws`
3. Do a catkin_make `catkin_make install`
4. Open a new terminal
5. execute `bash ~/Robotics_ICE23_UNITN/start.sh`
6. Check the Gazebo environment
7. Wait for Homing Procedure Accomplished
8. Select the **assignment number**
9. Select the **operating way**
10. Once you get the photo of the object recognition, press **c** in the vision terminal to complete the tasks
